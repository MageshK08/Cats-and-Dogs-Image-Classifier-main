# Bharat-Intern-Projects
TASK TO PERFORM

Note : Select a dataset for your project from Kaggle or choose one that suits your needs.

SMS Classifier : Develop a text classification model to classify SMS as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python.

Titanic Classification : Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.

Cat and Dog Image Classifier : Develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using data science techniques in Python.

We are required to accomplish a MINIMUM of 2 TASKS from the list of assigned tasks provided within your internship program.

So, I chose:- 2. Titanic classifier and 3. Cat and Dog Image Classifier.





## Cats-and-Dogs-Image-Classifier

2. Data analysis

3. Create image data generators

4. Set up the model

5. Load pretrained model

6. Create classification model

7. Training

8. Training the classification model

9. Fine-tuning

10. Evaluate the final model
